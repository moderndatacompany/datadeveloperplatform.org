# A modern way to run data engineering teams

> Data teams are drained with continuous plumbing around integrations and fragile pipelines which leaves little or no time to focus on the real value - data and data applications.

Businesses that have a good grasp on data realise the difference between winning and losing the competitive edge. Many data-first organizations understood this long back and dedicated major projects to becoming data-first. The likes of Uber, Google, and Airbnb has shown an inspiring discipline around data.

But what does data-first mean? As the name suggests, it is putting data and data-powered decisions first while de-prioritising everything else either through abstractions or delegation to intelligent design architectures.

However, replicating data-first organisations who took years to develop their platforms is not the solution since their stacks were and are catered to their specific internal architectures. A data-first stack is only truly data-first if it is built in accordance with your internal infrastructure.

Therefore, we have the Data Developer Platform infrastructure specification, established and rolled out specifically for the data domain with strong inspiration from the well-proven and acclaimed Internal Developer Platform spec. We have tried to mirror the site structure as much as possible so readers can easily correlate the fundamentals.

## Who should read the Data Developer Platform site?
The data developer platform specification has been made with the ideology "of the people, by the people, for the people." In other words, it is made by data developers and engineers for data developers and engineers, and undoubtedly belongs to the lot. It is entirely open for development and improvement with thee aid and influence of fresh technology.

## How to contribute to the Data Developer Platform?
We are always looking to improve and innovate the spec by taking into account valuable suggestions and inputs from the community. For any recommendation, reach out to us at info@tmdc.io
